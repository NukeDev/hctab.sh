This is a simple library, designed only for the .NET Framework, which allows the rapid creation of multi-step batch programs with scheduling included.
Through a simple configuration file (json for now, soon also through SQL database!) It is possible to configure the steps of the batch. The creation of a step occurs by extending the base class BatchStep and configuring the namespace relating to it in the json file. The activation and execution of the step takes place at runtime.

Many more updates and information soon! Even NuGet !!
